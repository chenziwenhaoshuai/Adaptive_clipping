# Adaptive_clipping
This project can be used to train image adaptive cropping in YOLO-TXT format, which is an effective performance enhancement method for target detection networks for small targets
Based on YOLOv5 v5.0 version of detect.py is finishing production, will upload the code later.
I hope the giter who downloaded the code can light up the star above.
